        </div>
        <p style="font-family:calibri light; font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">Because law schools do not generally teach new attorneys the business skills to run a law office, many offices have turned to technology to ease the learning curve and reduce clerical errors. The American Bar Association (ABA) has found that calendar and deadline related mistakes account for most legal malpractice claims. Therefore, an initial investment in software tools can yield long term savings in defending against such claims. The main purpose of this management software is to allow a law firm to run more smoothly.
