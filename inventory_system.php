        <p style="font-family:calibri light; font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">Norak POS and Inventory Management Software offers a rich collection of features that are totally unique from other systems.

            	<h5 style="font-family:calibri light; font-weight:bold;  color:#41d8d1;">INTEGRATED SYSTEM </h5>
                <p style="font-family:calibri light; font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">⦁	Because your business management software should actually help you run your business, not just be a glorified cash register, why not make sure that this time your investment is scalable and flexible?  If your business evolves, shouldn't your business management software be able to evolve too?
                An integrated point of sale system cuts down your workload by ensuring that you only have to enter your information once and it is placed everywhere it needs to be. Staff can create an invoice without knowing anything about accounting or inventory control, yet the invoice they enter automatically updates those sections of the entire system.
                Integration with receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and pole displays will greatly enhance your checkout speed, professionalism, and customer service.</p>
